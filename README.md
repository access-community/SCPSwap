# SCPSwap ![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/EscapeTheFacility/SCPSwap) ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/EscapeTheFacility/SCPSwap/total) 
This is a port of the SCPSwap plugin by DentyTxR (and BuildBoy12) to NWAPI. Most of the code has been taken from the original repo.
Currently the CustomSwaps API has been removed due to issues while loading, it will be reinplemented in the future.

DentyTxR's version of the plugin (for EXILED) can be found [here](https://github.com/DentyTxR/ScpSwap).

### Why this fork?
This remove the dependencies with NWPS permissions plugins

### Features
- Allows players to swap between SCP roles with commands
- Configuration on allowed swap roles, timings and messages

<s>
## Permissions
